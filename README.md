# Shopping Predictions

An assignment for the class Statistical Methods for Computer Science. 
The goal was to analyse data on shopping behaviour.
I was given a data file consisting of rows of data. Each row i corresponds to one supermarke shopping basket and each column j corresponds to one item for sale. The value Zi,j
in row i, column j gives how many of the j’th item are in the i’th shopping basket.
Correlations were found using different statistical methods.

The repository includes:
1) Pdf file with the questions
2) File of data
3) My statistical code on a Jupyter Notebook 
4) Pdf file including my observations on the results
